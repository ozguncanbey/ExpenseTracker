# ExpenseTracker

ExpenseTracker is a simple expense viewing application that helps you keep track of your personal or business expenses. The app consists of two main screens: a main screen listing your expenses and a screen for adding new expenses.

## Main Screen

On the main screen, the expenses you've added are listed in chronological order. Expenses are listed from bottom to top, so the newest expenses are displayed at the top. Expenses are categorized into "Personal," "Business," and "Other." Beneath each expense, you'll find the name, description, amount spent, and date of the expense. If the list is empty, a "No expenses yet" message is displayed.

## Add New Expense Screen

To add a new expense, you can access the new expense entry screen by tapping the plus (+) button in the upper right corner. To add a new expense, enter the following information:

- **Title**: The name or title of the expense.
- **Description**: A description of the expense.
- **Amount Spent**: The amount spent.
- **Date**: The date on which the expense was made.
- **Category**: The category of the expense. Choose from "Personal," "Business," or "Other."

After adding a new expense, it will automatically appear on the main screen.
